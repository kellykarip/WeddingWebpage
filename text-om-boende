# Resa till Ammouliani
If you are comming from outside Greece, the airport you should fly to is <b>Thessaloniki Airport</b> (SKG), called <i>Makedonia</i>. From the Airport it is a two hours drive to <b>Tripiti</b> in Chalkidki and from Tripiti it takes 15 minutes to reach the island of <a href="http://www.visitammouliani.com/en/homepage/">Ammouliani</a> by Ferry. The Ferry takes both people and cars and LÄGGER TILL at the village of <b>Ammouliani</b>.
							
It is good to check with the hotel you choose to stay at in Ammouliani if they provide <b>transfer</b> to your hotel from Thessaloniki Airport. If they do it could be nice to book that if you want to smoothly get to you hotel. On the other hand, if you want to be able to easily move around on the island during your vacation and/or having the possibility of travelling around in the area of Chalkidiki we <b>highly recommend</b> you to <b>rent a car</b>. If you are thinking of renting a car it is probably best to rent it already from the Airport and travel to Ammouliani by car, because the car renting services on the island are probably limited. The Airport is on the right side of Thessaloniki when travelling to Chalkidiki, so you don't need to worry about needing to drive through the city center of Thessaloniki to get to Ammouliani island.

The whole area of Chalkidiki is famous for its many, many amazingly beautiful beaches so if you have time and want to explore the area we definitly recommend you to take the opportunity to travel to other places in Chalkidiki too either for staying there over night or for daily trips! Our favorite places and beaches, besides Ammouliani, are located on the middle peninsula of Chalkidiki's three peninsulas. The three places we like the most are Neos Marmaras, a really beautiful and quite big village with a nice and really long beach and a lot of restaurants, bars and LIV O RÖRELSE, Kalamitsi a smaller village with definitly one of Chalkidiki's nicest beaches and Porto Koufo a small fishing village located in a lagoon, "hidden" from the open sea but with very deep water inside, where the Greek navy historically have been hiding to surprise enemies.

# Where to stay at in Ammouliani

The Wedding dinner and party will be at the <b>Agionissi Resort</b> and therefore the absolutely most convinient place to stay at is Agionissi Resort. To book rooms there you can either visit the Resort's <a href="https://agionissiresort.reserve-online.net/about">webpage</a> or look for the Resort at your favorite hotel-booking site. 

Agionissi Resort is the most expensive alternateive on the island, so if you want to stay at another place we recommend the island's, Ammouliani's, own <a href="http://www.visitammouliani.com/en/homepage/">webpage</a> where you can find suggestions on different hotels but also other information about the island. There are many more alternatives on hotel's than the ones mentioned on the island's web page so it is a smart idea to check your favorite hotel-booking site for more alternatives.

The Ferry to Ammouliani LÄGGER TILL at the <b>village of Ammouliani</b> which is where most <b>restaurants, cafés and stores</b> are located on the island. If you prefer to be close to these things you might want to look for a hotel that is located in the village of Ammouliani. Most of the hotels/apartments, at least 20 different, are located in the actual village.

Agionissi Resort is on a 2,6 km distance from the village (that's the reason why we can party all night long there ;) ) so if you would prefer to stay <b>closer to Agionissi Resort</b> it might be smart to check the following hotels out. We have not done any further research on them so we can really not promise anything about how good/bad they are. The only thing we have checked is their distance to Agionissi Resort. <a href="http://www.pyrgosrooms.gr/active.aspx?mode=en{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}View">Pyrgos rooms</a> is the Resort's closest neighbour only <b>350 meters</b> away, <a href="http://lianiammos.gr/">Liani ammos</a> apartments is <b>1,1 km</b> from Agionissi Resort, <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotel_Review-g1060379-d1060572-Reviews-Alikes_Sea_Front_Apartments-Ammouliani_Halkidiki_Region_Central_Macedonia.html">Alikes Sea-front Apartments</a> is located on the most famous beach of Ammouliani, Alikes, and is located <b>1,5 km</b> from Agionissi Resort and <a href="http://athosbaygr1.weebly.com/">Athos Bay Villa</a> is located <b>1,7 km</b> from Agionissi Resort. To reach Liani ammos apartments, Alikes Sea-front Apartments and Athos Bay Villa the most convinient way would be to drive because the roads connecting them with Agionissi Resort are proper car roads, but if you bring a pair of confortable shoes to walk in maybe you can walk the distances.
